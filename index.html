					<h3>Research Assistant @ <a href="https://www.brown.edu">Brown University</a></h3>
					<h5>Jun 2024 - Sep 2024</h5>
				</header>
				<p>
					My advisor, <a href="https://nikos.vasilak.is">Nikos Vasilakis</a>, and I, along with the
					colleagues I'm leading, are working on a drop-in replacement for Bash called Fish. Our system
					parallelizes Bash scripts before distributing them across nodes, with the ability to recover from
					node failures. I was offered a paid summer internship at Brown University for this work, which has
					been an almost yearlong project, and we plan to submit it to OSDI 2025 in December. Throughout
					this project, I've gained extensive experience with Bash scripting, Python, Go, and gRPC.

					<h3>Software Engineer @ <a href="https://hazelcast.com">Hazelcast</a></h3>
					<h5>Dec 2020 - July 2023</h5>
				</header>
				<p>
					Hazelcast started as a distributed in-memory key-value store
					and expanded into processing and storage. I joined the Jet (stream processing engine) team as an
					intern and moved to the core team shortly after. I was then offered a full-time position and since
					it was my first full-time job, I hold very fond memories of this company and learned a lot about
					stream processing, concurrency, distributed systems, Java, and its memory model. Before I left for
					my master's, I was also part of the TPC team, which aimed to redesign Hazelcast with a
					thread-per-core architecture, similar to ScyllaDB or Redpanda. Through this effort, I learned more
					about Linux storage APIs and their trade-offs.

					<h3>Machine Learning Intern @ <a href="https://www.pragmacraft.com">PragmaCraft</a></h3>
					<h5>Jul 2019 - Dec 2019</h5>
				</header>
				<p>
					During my time at PragmaCraft, I worked on a project that aimed to summarize the content of
					webpages for a given search query in Google search results. I used a combination of extractive and
					abstractive summarization techniques to achieve this. I familiarized myself with transformers and
					BERT, which were very new at that time. However, because Google implemented the snippet feature,
					the project later evolved into <a href="https://enterprise.answie.com">Answie</a>, which aimed to
					provide semantic search for enterprises.
